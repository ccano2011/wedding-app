## Overview

_**Happily Ever After** is a full CRUD React web application that will allow for couples planning their wedding to have a website for guests to RSVP, post their well-wishes, & view the photos of the bride & groom throughout their years in addition to the standard wedding website fare._

<br>

## MVP

<!-- > The Minimum Viable Product should be a well-planned, easily-communicated product, ensuring that the client's deliverable will be achievable and meet specifications within the time frame estimated. -->

<!-- _The **Project Title** MVP lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus dapibus fermentum risus vitae bibendum. Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex. In quis fringilla velit, ac maximus quam. Etiam eget placerat neque. Aenean faucibus sem non nisi lobortis ullamcorper._ -->

- Build a functional **Ruby-on-Rails** backend with a database that will utilize CRUD with 3 tables; (User, Food, & Posts)
- Set up one association between the 3 tables (1:m)
- Build a feature complete **React** frontend with CRUD 
- Build out the 10 screens (Our Story, Photos, RSVP, Cork Board for Posting, Resgistration, Login, Create post, edit post, registry, Home, & Travel) with the apropriate number of components to manage the screens
- Build out the controllers that will allow the frontend to display and update data from the backend
- Style using CSS & Flexbox with 3 media queries 

<br>

### Goals

- _Demonstate my understanding of data table associations,_
- _Create a template so that I may be able to use this for future projects,_
- _Improve my CSS abilities,_

<br>

### Libraries and Dependencies

<!-- > _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._ -->

<!-- - Build out logic that will prevent duplicate RSVPs -->
- Use CSS framework to incorporate animations
- Add a rotating photo gallery for "Our Story" component
<!-- - Implement Full CRUD to the RSVP component -->

***

## Code Showcase:

> Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of and a brief description.

## Code Issues & Resolutions:

Major issue with CORs on the deployed site resolved by doing the following:
 - added gems 'rails_12factor' and 'foreman' to my gemfile,
 - specified my rails application cors.rbâ€™s origins to only coming from my deployed netlify & localhost:3001,
   making a Procfile with the heroku commands ````web: bundle exec rails s ```` & ````release: bundle exec bin/rake db:migrate````.
